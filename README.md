# Py-notepad

A simple cross-platform windows notepad clone written in python.
A single class file contains all the functions that the text editor requires.

Supports syntax highlight for python programs. It also has a neat data/time insert along with all cool key bindings you require to run the program.
It can handle fairly large files unlike the windows version.
